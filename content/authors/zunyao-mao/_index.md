Zach Davis is a PhD student in cognitive science at NYU, supervised by [Bob Rehder](https://psych.nyu.edu/rehder/). His research involves using computational methods to study how limited agents (i.e. people) are able to grapple with our complex world. These interests have led to projects investigating how people control dynamic environments, learn the structure of chaotic systems as they unfold in real time, and make scalable causal judgments.
